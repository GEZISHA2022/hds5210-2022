# Feedback on Final

I think your overall project is a good one, but here are a few notes:
1. One of the requirements was to merge or join multiple data sets. It looks like your work was just a demonstration of concatenating different subsets of files that all contained the same data. This only earns partial credit for data merging.
2. I liked your "remove commas" function, but there were other opportunities to use functions for abstraction to simplify your code. Even the "remove commas" function could have done more.
